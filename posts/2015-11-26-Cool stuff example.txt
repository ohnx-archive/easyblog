This is an equation that is parsed by `MathJax`.
$$3x=2$$

Here's some fancy greek

$$\alpha = \frac{2x}{3}$$

Can you integrate this?

$$\int_0^1 x^2 \, \mathrm{d}x = \frac{1}{3} \simeq 1.333333333333$$

What is the sine of an angle in radians?

$$sin(\alpha) = x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!} \ldots$$

Man, that's complicated!
